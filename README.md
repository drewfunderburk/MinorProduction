# Proximo One
Inspired heavily by the arcade games Galaga and 1942, Proximo One is a fast-paced, hectic top-down shooter with scaling difficulty and permadeath. Fight through waves of enemies while your warp drive charges, choosing when itâ€™s finished to either channel that energy into your shields for a big heal, or warp to the next planet as you are. Redoing the current planet will see the enemies increase slightly in difficulty, but otherwise give you a chance to catch their breath while moving on will increase the difficulty, but also the rewards. Survive and kill as many enemies as possible before your shields run out to claim the highest score!

Controls:
- WASD to move
- Left Mouse to Fire
